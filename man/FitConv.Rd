\title{Fit and Converge a Jags model}
\usage{
FitConv(JAGSdata = NULL, modellist = NULL, gelmanthr = 1.05,
  StepIt = 1000, MaxIt = 10000, FinalSampleLength = 500, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{JAGSdata}{A pre-prepared jags data object}

\item{modellist}{A vector containing the location and names
of the jags model files. These files should be read in R,
as a modelstring. These files must also generate a vector of
model parameter names to be return (in a object called interestlist)}

\item{gelmanthr}{Gelman threshold values to except fit}

\item{StepIt}{what is the standard number of MCMC samples to
take before checking for convergence?}

\item{MaxIt}{What is the maximum number of MCMC samples}

\item{FinalSampleLength}{How many posterior sample do you need
when the model is returned?}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be passed to \code{jags.model}}
}
\description{
\code{FitConv} - runs a Jags model, or list of models,
and checks for convergence using gelman stats. It then
returns a list of MCMC samples, a jags model and DIC values.
