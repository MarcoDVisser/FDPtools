D	Found dead on the second pass of the first census in 1983, after being tagged for the first time in 1982. This code should generally 	be ignored, because these plants were alive in 1982
F	Fallen or missing
G 	Plant to be removed from current quadrat
H	Plant moved into present quadrat
L	Leaning
N	Found and tagged on the second pass of first census in 1983,
was not seen in 1982
P	Prostrate
R	Reproductive (infrequently used)
S	Suckering
V	Vines on 50% or more of the plant's crown
X	Broken
Z	?

		H	Through human activity
		O	Major rot in trunk
		T	Major split or break in trunk without rot

L	Leaning, followed by:
		B	Branch over trunk
		H	Through human activity		
		K	Rock over trunk

	1995 - Leaning, at any angle

M	Multiple-stemmed plant

Q	Broken above 1.3 m

R	Resprout, with the originally measured stem gone below 1.3 m, but a
	new stem sprouting
